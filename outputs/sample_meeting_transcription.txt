Good morning everyone, thank you for joining today's project review meeting. Let's start with the status updates from each team.

Sarah, could you begin with the development team progress? 

Sure, thanks Mark. We've completed the user authentication module and the dashboard interface. The API integration is currently at 80% completion, and we expect to finish by Friday. We did encounter some challenges with the third-party service integration, but we've worked around those issues.

That's great progress. How about the testing team, Mike?

We've been running automated tests on the completed modules. So far, we've identified 12 minor bugs and 2 critical issues. The critical issues are related to data validation, and we're working closely with Sarah's team to resolve them. We expect to have a clean test run by Monday.

Excellent. Lisa, any updates from the design team?

Yes, we've finalized the UI mockups for the remaining screens. We're also working on the mobile responsiveness guidelines. The style guide has been updated and shared with the development team. We should have all design assets ready by Wednesday.

Perfect. Now, let's discuss the budget and timeline. Based on current progress, we're tracking well against our original timeline. However, we need to allocate additional resources for the integration testing phase.

I suggest we schedule a follow-up meeting next Friday to review the final deliverables before the client presentation. Does everyone have availability at 2 PM?

That works for me.

Same here.

Great, I'll send out calendar invites. Any other questions or concerns before we wrap up?

Just a quick note - we'll need access to the staging environment by Thursday for the integration tests.

Noted. I'll coordinate with the IT team to ensure access is granted. Thanks everyone, have a great week.
